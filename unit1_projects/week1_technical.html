        <h1>Week 1 Technical Blog</h1>
        <h2>Website Design</h2>
        <h3>What makes a good website?</h3>
        <p>I had mny opinions about website design and it was really interesting to read all the design thinking materials this week. For me the most important thing about a website is that it is simple and easy to use. This is probably because I am somewhat "technically challenged" and I hate confusing sites. I prefer when a site has a simple and easy to understand flow that allows me to seemlessly find what I need. This is very difficult to accomplish, especially when a site has numerous uses and features. Below I have listed my top three favorite sites and why I enjoy using them!</p>
        <ul>

            <li><a href="http://www.airbnb.com">Airbnb.com</a>
                <p>This is one of my favorite sites because it is so simple and easy to use. I come to the site when I want to book hotel reservations. This is one of my least favorite tasks yet they make it simple and less painful. The first thing that draws my eye when I see the page is the search bar in the middle of the page. This allows me to easily find what I need. When I take a step back I notice the amazing photos of some of the rental options available. While these are usually expensive options (way above my price range) it always puts me in a good mood because I start to think about my trip. I really like the business model and the services that Airbnb offers but I use them instead of their competitors because of how easy they are to use.<br><br>
                This website allows me to quickly and easily book rooms for when I travel. It saves me money because the rooms are cheaper than hotels but it also saves me time because I am able to quickly find and book what I need. If I were to describe them in five words I would use; organized, simple, easy, fast and fun. The website contains an inventory of rooms in different cities that are available for short term rental. It gives me many search options that allow me to prioritize price, location or amenities so that I can find exactly what I need fast. It also gives me information about the owner and reviews from past renters so that I can make a better decision. I would describe the content of the site as practical, useful and sometimes boring but also funny and interesting. This is because they allow users to post content so while much of it is boring sometimes I see a really funny review that makes it much more interesting. The content description is different from the website description because of what I said earlier, I hate booking hotels. I like the site and it makes the experience much less painful but still not quite enjoyable.<br><br>
                I think that the content on the site is organized to enable me to find exactly what I need quick. I rarely spend more than 15 minutes on the site but that is why I use them. I have used them many times to book rooms and for the most part have had a positive experience. Even when things didn’t go great I would not blame the company, I would blame my host. They also created a great community that encourages people to contribute content. I rarely write reviews on other sites but I have done so may times for Airbnb. I write the reviews because I find other peoples reviews very helpful for my decisions and because I want to pay back the host for their hospitality. My one criticism of the site is that they don’t have a feature that allows users to easily view the beds available at each location. Sometimes I am booking for a large number of people and it would be great to view how many twin, queen and sofa beds each location has. Many hosts put this information in their description but not all.

                <p>Ok so this is the last website that I built so I admit that my opinion may be biased but I love it. The reasons are very similar to Airbnb because I modeled the site after theirs. I built the site using Wordpress and it is only an MVP (minimum violable product) so it does not have all the features that I wanted. My goal was to make it simple and easy to use. It allows people to set up events, invite friends and easily book venues.I started the company in Singapore to solve a problem that I had organizing dinners for large groups of people. The service in Singapore is really bad and I had a few painful dinning experiences and I thought I could build something that would solve this problem. The idea is simple, browse restaurants offering pre-set family style meals at discounted prices. Select one that you like, book a table and invite friends. The friends can see the menu and pay in advance online. This eliminates the need for the waiter to take the order and also split checks at the end of the meal. Based on our preliminary testing restaurants and users loved the product.<br><br>
                The goal of the site was to create an easy way for people to create and manage the events. Currently it takes a few phone calls and a deposit just to book a table. Then the organizer needs to invite guests either using Whatsapp, facebook or email. All this is time consuming so we tried to make the process simple. The site was designed with the help of my business partner. We wanted it to be easy and elegant. We chose images that would make people feel good and remember entice them to book. We put in content to inform them of the dining experiences offered and our main focus was “food and friends”. Their were a few features that are missing such as an integrated billing and event management system. For the moment we were doing it manually using Peatix (similar to Eventbrite).

            <li><a href="http://google.com">Google</a><br>
                <p>I like Google because they have so many features yet it is still easy to use. On the home page the first thing that I notice is the search bar in the middle of the page. This is the number one feature that I use on Google. Then they have links to my most visited websites along with other Google products such as email and maps. I would describe the page as clean, easy, fast, fun, and plain. This website is my home page and it solves so many of my problems. I use it for maps, translation, email, Google+ and more. What is amazing to me is that one site can have so many uses yet still be so clean. I like that they don’t have many distractions, such as the background photos on Bing. It is also nice that every once in a while they have an animation or game above the search bar. This keeps the site fun but doesn’t waist too much of my time.<br><br>
                Since I use the site every day I can find exactly what I am looking for quick. They even have my most visited websites displayed so I can navigate to them fast. Google does sell some products and services but their main source of revenue is advertising. I have never purchased anything directly from Google and I rarely click on their ads. The ads are the most annoying part of the experience but they are still not as bad as their competitors so I put up with them.
