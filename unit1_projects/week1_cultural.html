		<h2>The <em>Dev Bootcamp</em> experience</h2>
		<div id ="content">
	
		    <p>I just watched a video of Shereef, the founder of Dev Bootcamp, where he explains what to expect out of the program.  must admit that i am very impressed and it makes me excited to think that I will be there soon. I am somewhat skepticle of a few of the things that he said. I loved his comparison of kitchen to a restaurant. Maybe that's because I am a chef! I want to believe that the place is much more like a kitchen where everone collaborates than a restaurant where everone consummes but it is very difficult to maintain a "kitchen culture. Dev Bootcamp is growing fast and I don't know how well they will be able to establish this culture as they open more campuses. I guess it is up to me to contribute to the culture. Overall I really liked Shereef and the story of how Dev Bootcamp was established. </p>
			<p>I have worked in compeditive and collaborative environments and I prefer the latter. I am looking forward to a transformative experience. My expectations of the program have definately gone up. When I enrolled I was very focused on the technical skills that I would gain and I didn't consider the softer skills or the overall experience. I watched the SIY video for the interview and I heard about the Yoga but I didn't understand how seriously they take culture. Most schools say that they are selective and that they have collaborative cultures. I would like to think that it is true but I will remain skeptical until I experience it for myself.
		    </P>
		    <p>I am both nervous and excited to join Dev Bootcamp. I am having some difficulties with the phase 1 work and that is adding to my anxiety. I have never been good with certain aspects of technology. It is also really different to start over again. I am used to being an expert in my feild and now I feel like I don't know anything. Even worse, I really don't know anything! One of the things that has been really encouraging is my contacvt with others in my cohort and the Dev Bootcamp staff. i was nervous because I missed a deadline and they completely understood. This is not what i had expected and it really helped to have someone try to help instead of getting upset.
