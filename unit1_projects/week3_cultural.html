  		<h2>Inside My Mind</h2>
  		<p>I have been struggling with all the work from Dev Bootcamp over the past few weeks. It is really difficult for me to work alone and learn from tutorials. I am a Aural/Kinesthetic learner so I have been spending lots of time watching YouTube videos and doing practice exercises. I am horrible at taking notes and that is a real weakness because sometimes I have to repeat material over and over again. I hope that once I am at Dev Bootcamp and working with the instructors and my classmates I will learn much quicker.</p><br>
  		<p>One of the major problems that I have are rabbit holes. I have a tendency to get stuck on something and spend hours trying to solve it. I am dealing with this in several ways. First I will usually take a break for a few minutes and do something else to clear my mind. This helps a lot and most of the time when I get back to work I can easily spot my error. If that doesnâ€™t work then I will ask for help. I can either talk with a classmate or go online to a tutoring site to talk over my code with someone else. When I am able to talk about it with someone I am usually able to spot my own mistake before they do. These rabbit holes can be very dangerous and have caused me to be late on assignments many times.</p><br>
  		<p>One of my other problems is time management. It feels like I am always in a rush and I never have time to complete what I need to. I have tried many different techniques but it is still very difficult. One of the most useful ones is the pomodoro technique of focusing on one thing for 25 minutes and then taking a five-minute break. I find that I am much more productive when I do that. I am also trying to schedule time to work on my projects in the day so that I am not tired. This requires me to make lots of sacrifices but I think that it will be worth it.</p>
