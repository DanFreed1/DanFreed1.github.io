  		<h2>JavaScript</h2>
  		<p>JavaScript is widely used in web development and it has many benefits and limitations. I will talk about my personal experience with it this week. First off, while many people say it is easy to learn I would disagree. One of the tutorials I went through talked about how Ruby was written with humans in mind and JavaScript was written more for the computers. I could not agree more. I don't think that it is dificult, at least not the things that I learned this week, but the syntax is not easy to get used to. Ruby looks almost like English and it is fairly easy to follow the logic; JavaScript might as well be in Russian. I think with more practice it will get easier but I would say it is dificult to learn. Also JavaScript has lots of extra syntax that you have to add such as (). Every function must have a set of parenthesis even if they are empty. And many methods that are already defined in Ruby, such as "puts" need to be made in JavaScript. This is not such a big deal but it does slow you down.</p><br>
  		<p>The great things about JavaScript are that it is well supported and easy to find open source libraries and code. I really like the ability to edit code directly in the Chrome Console. This makes it easy to debug. We learned about "Test Driven Development" this week and it made many of the challenges much easier because you can find bugs in real time and use test code to work faster. I watched a few tutorials on JavaScript and they mentioned that the ability to prototype objects is one of it's strong points. I am still trying to understand exactly what that means so I can't really explain it well but it makes it much easier to scale code. If I want to make changes I only have to make it in one place and it will automatically change all the other places. This is done by linking objects together. </p><br>
  		<p>Overall I really enjoyed this unit and I am looking forward to learning more!</p>
